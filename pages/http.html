                <h4><strong>HTTP Protocol</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the
                    foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests
                    are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from
                    the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts,
                    and more.
                </p>


                <h4><strong>HTTPS Protocol</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary
                    protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to
                    increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive
                    data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.

            <p>
                HTTPS protects the communication between your browser and server from being intercepted and tampered
                with by attackers. This provides confidentiality, integrity and authentication to the vast majority of
                todayâ€™s WWW traffic.

                Any website that shows a lock icon in the address bar is using HTTPS.

                <strong>HTTP</strong>
                <br>
                HTTP is the most common protocol you see on the Internet. It provides the gateway for community between
                your computer or device, the client, and the website or online resource found on a server. Typically,
                when you click on a result in a search engine or type a URL into your browser, you're making an HTTP
                request. Most websites that don't need to protect information use HTTP, including news websites, blogs,
                business sites and even advertisement pop-ups.

            <strong>HTTPS</strong>
            <br>

            HTTP Secure is an extension of HTTP with an extra protocol that encrypts and protects your information.
            This protocol requires that you authenticate yourself with the website, which helps to protect any
            sensitive information shared between you and the Web server. Websites that use HTTPS include banks,
            email clients and e-commerce sites. When you log in to these sites, you often see "https" in the
            protocol portion of the URL.

            <strong>HTTPD</strong>
            <br>

            The "HTTPD" protocol represents a Web server where the "d" stands for "daemon." The daemon itself is a
            program that waits for requests, such as for Web pages or multimedia files, and forwards them to the
            appropriate resources. You don't see "HTTPD" in URL as you would "HTTP" or "HTTPS." If you run a website
            using your own server, you may use a file, often named "httpd.conf" to configure and direct network
            traffic, including where you store images and files.

            <strong>XHTTP</strong>
            <br>
            The Extended HTTP protocol sends requests and responses as headers, meaning they pass only information
            relating to a Web session, including encoding, cookie data, connections, content-type, and warnings,
            among others. Like HTTP daemons, you do not see XHTTP in a URL. Web servers use XHTTP to establish Web
            sessions, which helps to determine which content you see, such as full websites on your computer or
            mobile sites on your smartphone. Servers use these headers in conjunction with other types of HTTP
            protocols.
