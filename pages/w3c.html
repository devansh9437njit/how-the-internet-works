                The Web Real-Time Communications Working Group has published WebRTC 1.0: Real-Time Communication Between
                Browsers as a W3C Recommendation. This document defines a set of JavaScript APIs to allow media and
                generic application data to be exchanged with another browser or device implementing the appropriate set
                of real-time protocols defined in IETF.

            <h4><strong>HTML</strong></h4>
            <p>
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
                example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using
                images and data tables
            </p>


            <h4><strong>CSS</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
                document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide
                Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

            The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European
            Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October, 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the European Commission, the Defense
            Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the
            Internet. It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with CSAIL, to the Stata
            Center.

        The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new
        standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing
        inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a
        set of core principles and components that are chosen by the consortium.

        <strong>Web document Creation</strong>
        <br>
        HTML is heavily used for creating pages that are displayed on the world wide web. Every page contains a set of
        HTML tags including hyperlinks which are used for connecting to other pages. Every page that we witness, on the
        world wide web, is written using a version of HTML code.

        <p class="my-4"></p>
        <strong>Web pages development</strong>
        <br>
        Document creation on the internet is dominated by HTML and its basic concept via tag and DOM i.e. document
        object model. HTML tags are inserted before and afterward or phrases to locate their format and location on the
        page. A web document consists of three sections: title, head, and body. Head includes the information to
        identify the document, including title and any other important keyword. A title can be seen on the browserâ€™s bar
        and the body section is the main portion of the website visible to the viewer. All three segments are designed
        and created by the uses of HTML tags. Every section has its own specific set of tags, which are dedicatedly
        rendered keeping the head, title and body concepts in a loop.

        <strong>Internet navigation</strong>
        <br>
        This is one of the most important uses of HTML which is revolutionary. This navigation is possible by utilizing
        the concept of Hypertext. It is basically a text which refers to other web pages or text and when user click on
        it, would navigate to referenced text or page. HTML is heavily used to embed the hyperlink within the web pages.
        A user can easily navigate within the web pages and between websites as well, which are located on different
        servers.
