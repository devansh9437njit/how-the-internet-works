                The Domain Name System (DNS) protocol is an important part of the web's infrastructure, serving as the
                Internet's phone book: every time you visit a website, your computer performs a DNS lookup. Complex
                pages often require multiple DNS lookups before they start loading, so your computer may be performing
                hundreds of lookups a day.

        <p>
            The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a
            computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet,
            and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to
            find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user
            types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the
            example.com webpage.

        <p>
            The DNS directory that matches name to numbers isn’t located all in one place in some dark corner of the
            internet. With more than 332 million domain names listed at the end of 2017, a single directory would be
            very large indeed. Like the internet itself, the directory is distributed around the world, stored on domain
            name servers (generally referred to as DNS servers for short) that all communicate with each other on a very
            regular basis to provide updates and redundancies.


            <img 
                src="../imgs/img3.png" 
                alt=""
                width="600px"
                height="400px"
                >
            <br>
            <br>
            <hr>
        <p class="my-4"></p>

        Each domain can correspond to more than one IP address. In fact, some sites have hundreds or more IP addresses
        that correspond with a single domain name. For example, the server your computer reaches for www.google.com is
        likely completely different from the server that someone in another country would reach by typing the same site
        name into their browser.

        Another reason for the distributed nature of the directory is the amount of time it would take for you to get a
        response when you were looking for a site if there was only one location for the directory, shared among the
        millions, probably billions, of people also looking for information at the same time. That’s one long line to
        use the phone book.

        <br>
        <p class="my-4"></p>

        To get around this problem, DNS information is shared among many servers. But information for sites visited
        recently is also cached locally on client computers. Chances are that you use google.com several times a day.
        Instead of your computer querying the DNS name server for the IP address of google.com every time, that
        information is saved on your computer so it doesn’t have to access a DNS server to resolve the name with its IP
        address. Additional caching can occur on the routers used to connect clients to the internet, as well as on the
        servers of the user’s Internet Service Provider (ISP). With so much caching going on, the number of queries that
        actually make it to DNS name servers is a lot lower than it would seem.

        Generally speaking, the DNS server you use will be established automatically by your network provider when you
        connect to the internet. If you want to see which servers are your primary nameservers — generally the recursive
        resolver, as described above — there are web utilities that can provide a host of information about your current
        network connection. Browserleaks.com is a good one, and it provides a lot of information, including your current
        DNS servers.
