            <h4><strong>Domain Names</strong></h4>
            <p>
                A domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or
                control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and for
                application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network
                domain,
                or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the
                Internet, a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated
                via
                the Internet. In 2017, 330.6 million domain names had been registered.
            </p>


            <h4><strong>ICANN</strong></h4>
            <p>
                The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN /ˈaɪkæn/ EYE-kan) is an American
                multistakeholder group and nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and
                procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring
                the network's stable and secure operation

        <p>
            A DNS service such as Amazon Route 53 is a globally distributed service that translates human readable names
            like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each
            other. The Internet’s DNS system works much like a phone book by managing the mapping between names and
            numbers. DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses, controlling which server an end user
            will reach when they type a domain name into their web browser. These requests are called queries.

        <p>
            Before the establishment of ICANN, the IANA function of administering registries of Internet protocol
            identifiers (including the distributing top-level domains and IP addresses) was performed by Jon Postel, a
            Computer Science researcher who had been involved in the creation of ARPANET, first at UCLA and then at
            USC-ISI. In 1997 Postel testified before Congress that this had come about as a "side task" to this
            research work. The Information Sciences Institute was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, as was
            SRI International's Network Information Center, which also performed some assigned name functions.

            <br>
            <p class="my-4"></p>

            As the Internet grew and expanded globally, the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated a process to establish
            a new organization to perform the IANA functions. On January 30, 1998, the National Telecommunications and
            Information Administration (NTIA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, issued for comment, "A
            Proposal to Improve the Technical Management of Internet Names and Addresses." The proposed rule making, or
            "Green Paper", was published in the Federal Register on February 20, 1998, providing opportunity for
            public comment. NTIA received more than 650 comments as of March 23, 1998, when the comment period
            closed.

            <br>
            <p class="my-4"></p>

            The Green Paper proposed certain actions designed to privatize the management of Internet names and
            addresses in a manner that allows for the development of competition and facilitates global participation in
            Internet management. The Green Paper proposed for discussion a variety of issues relating to DNS management
            including private sector creation of a new not-for-profit corporation (the "new corporation") managed by a
            globally and functionally representative board of directors.ICANN was formed in response to this
            policy. ICANN managed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) under contract to the
            United States Department of Commerce (DOC) and pursuant to an agreement with the IETF.
            
            <br>
            <p class="my-4"></p>

            ICANN was incorporated in California on September 30, 1998, with entrepreneur and philanthropist Esther
            Dyson as founding chairwoman.It is a nonprofit public benefit corporation "organized under the
            California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law for charitable and public purposes." ICANN was
            established in California due to the presence of Jon Postel, who was a founder of ICANN and was set to be
            its first Chief Technology Officer prior to his unexpected death. ICANN formerly operated from the same
            Marina del Rey building where Postel formerly worked, which is home to an office of the Information Sciences
            Institute at the University of Southern California. However, ICANN's headquarters is now located in the
            nearby Playa Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles.
